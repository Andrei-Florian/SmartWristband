It is needless to say that COVID-19 has changed the world as we know it. Business moved from office to home, school closed and our lives became a daily routine of wondering around the house.
Although I am sure that everyone heard this echo throughout the quarantine, I too would like to dedicate a paragraph to all the front line workers that keep working away in this insecure world as we all bunker in at home. It does take courage and determination to save lives (be that through nursing patients in hospitals or shipping supplies worldwide).
I found myself overreading this topic in the past while, I ended up spending a couple of hours thinking of solutions that would help the world in this fragile moment, solutions that could make a change and help us thrive in a world that shifts beneath our feet.

I looked at caring for people with weak forms of the virus. A category of people which are often overlooked. These are the people that were unfortunate to contract the virus but lucky to only have weak symptoms. But the health of these patients is extremely volatile and can worsen in a matter of hours. Their health must be monitored in detail.

As it turns out, countries have different approaches to tending for these patients: some will hospitalise them (crowding hospitals with patients that could be monitored off-campus), others send them to self-isolate at home. But there is a problem with the second option – these patients’ health could rapidly degenerate and hence have to be monitored.

There sure do exist heavy, bulky equipment that does this. But the problems are obvious; as the majority of the sick population will exert weak forms of the virus, these expensive, uncomfortable devices do not have the capacity to scale and be deployed to the entire population (because of the price and bulkiness). This is needless to say that some patients are tempted to “evade” their home and don’t really care about the virus, these people are a danger to society and themselves and should be monitored to ensure that they do not leave their home.

SmartWristband is a wristband held device that monitors the patient’s vitals and geolocation caring for their safety while they fight the virus within the constraints of their home. The device is powered by an Arduino MKR GSM 1400 and is equipped with both an IR temperature and heartrate sensor collecting crucial information about the patient’s health. Elevated temperature and irregular heart rate are signs of the progression of the virus. The patient will not notice these changes immediately, SmartWristband aims to do this and stream the data live and securely to the hospital monitoring the patient.

The device will also track the user’s location ensuring that they are at home at all times. All of this data is centralised in a scalable database allowing for thousands of these devices to be deployed internationally.

The hospital will have access to a dashboard where they will be able to see the health of all the patients being monitored at a glimpse as well as a specific report going into the detailed state of each patient.

Machine learning algorithms are also implemented in the application to predict the temperature and heartrate of the patient in the near future so that the hospital knows what to expect and when to hospitalise the patient.

The patient also has access to a mobile dashboard showing them their heart rate and temperature as well as when they will need to charge their wristband.

The device is comfortable enough for the patient to wear day and night without noticing it. SmartWristband will also notice if the user took the device off, alerting the hospital in this case.

SmartWristband is a low-cost, scalable, open sourcesolution for caring for patients sent to self-isolate with weak forms of the virus monitoring the development of their condition and alerting medical staff through machine learning and a simple-to-use dashboard experience if a patient requires attention.

This way, hospitals can send patients home and monitor them without the need to allocate a lot of human resources. SmartWristband can ensure that these patients are contained at home and are taken care of, helping the world in the fight with the virus.
